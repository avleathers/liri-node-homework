I used a "main" function to  make the request to Spotify, Bands in Town, or OMDB depending on what the user requested in the command line.

The function is followed by the "switch" command as an alternative to multiple if/else commands.

BUG:  I was getting "this is loaded" followed by data requested in the command line for Spotify and Bands in Town but never got data back for Movies.  Now I am only getting "this is loaded" and no data for any command.
