I used a "main" function to  make the request to Spotify, Bands in Town, or OMDB depending on what the user requested in the command line.

The function is followed by the "switch" command as an alternative to multiple if/else commands.

Was not able to get the Random function to work properly - just got the "this is loaded" message.
